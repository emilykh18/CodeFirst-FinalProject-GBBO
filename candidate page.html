            <head>Steph</head>
            <p>Steph’s grandad got her baking with his love of homemade bread.
She’s always loved making a mess in the kitchen, but she has been baking with a
vengeance for the past three or so years. She is primarily self-taught
and considers herself an ‘intermediate, still-learning’ baker.
Steph lives in Chester with her mum, and her passion for sports and wellness inspires her baking:
she enjoys the challenge of making her bakes healthier, adding vegetables or fruits,
lowering the refined sugar content and prioritising more nutritional fats.
Breads are Steph’s go-to bake – she relishes the challenge of creating a better version of a supermarket
favourite – but her signature bake is her sourdough loaf using her starter, which she calls ‘Sammy’.</p>

            <head>David</head>
            <p>David grew up in rural Yorkshire, where his mum (who baked all the time – the family never
    ate a shop-bought loaf at home) inspired him to start baking. His passion was further developed by his
    travels to Malawi (among other places) with his work as a Health Advisor, where he learnt to build an oven
    out of an oil drum and invented a cake that could steam cook over a village fire.
    David studied art and design before switching to nursing. When he’s not travelling the world for work,
    he lives in London and has lots of hobbies like cycling and ceramics. David’s baking repertoire is broad,
    but his strengths lie in bread. He’s not into fancy, colourful icings, but prefers robust flavours and good,
    solid bakes.</p>

            <head>Alice</head>
            <p>Alice grew up in a riverside town in Essex. At 15 years old, while recovering from a back operation
            for scoliosis and no longer able to do sport, she turned her hand to baking – and perfected the fruit 
            pavlova while she was living in New Zealand in her early 20s, where she also attended art school. After
            returning to the UK, she trained to be a Geography teacher. Now living in East London, she uses cakes in
            her lessons – demonstrating everything from coastal erosion to volcanic activity. She loves making highly
            decorative layered cakes for her friends and family. Her baking style 
            is intricate and delicate, full of flavour and enthusiasm – and has to make people go ‘wow!’</p>

        <head> Kim Joy</head>
        <p>Kim-Joy’s birthday falls on World Baking Day, which she takes as the surest sign there can be that she was
            born to bake. Born in Belgium to an English father and Malaysian–Chinese mother, she grew up in London,
            studied in both Bristol and Leeds, and now lives in Leeds with her partner. Her bustling, mixed-heritage
            background is reflected in her open attitude to all styles of baking, loving rustic baking just as much as
            she loves creating cute bakes with an emphasis on detail. Her baking passion, 
            though, is bread – she has turned her hand to pretty much every style and type of bread there is.</p>

            <head>Nadiya</head>
            <p>Nadiya has been baking for 10 years after wondering why her father only served ice cream for 
            dessert at his restaurant. Her family is originally from Bangladesh, where desserts aren’t a big
            feature of mealtimes, but encouraged by a school home economics teacher, Nadiya now delivers 
            beautiful masterpieces at family occasions. Born in Luton, she now lives in Leeds with her husband
            and is full time mum to their three children. Having put her career on the backburner to devote her
            life to her family, with their support she now feels inspired to have her own adventure – and make them
            proud.</p>

            <head>Sandi and Noel</head>
            <p>Erm, so Sandi and Noel aren't really bakers. They tend to eat the food, often before it's fully ready.
            From first hand experience, they recommend trying out some of the contestants' recipes here.</p>
